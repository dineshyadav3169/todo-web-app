# To-Do Web App
## Why did i build this?
I wanted to try how hard it would be to make a `web app` purely in javascript and CSS without any framework like react (library) or angular and spoiler alert it was quite painful ðŸ˜….

## How to use it?
First, `star` the repository (very important) then `clone` it or `fork` it.
